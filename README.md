# Flynn's Secure Grid Console — TRON-Inspired Security CLI

Flynn's Secure Grid Console is a security-focused, TRON-inspired command interface designed to simulate the digital GRID environment using safe modern practices.  
It combines authentication, RBAC, command whitelisting, input sanitization, threat detection, identity disc system, MCP-style reactions, TRON-style animations, and system sector simulation.

This repo contains the full implementation of a mid-sized secure console project completed over **two sprints** by a **three-member team**.

# Project Overview

Flynn’s Secure Grid Console is a command-line security framework with:
- PBKDF2 password hashing  
- SQLite-based identity & audit logging  
- Threat-word detection  
- TRON-style boot animation  
- Identity Disc system (per-user metadata & stats)  
- GRID scan, sector map, and lightwall security emulation  
- MCP-style behavior engine  
- Role-based command permissions  
- Command history tracking  

You can think of it as a **modern security console that feels like something inside the TRON universe**.
